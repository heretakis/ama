# Ask us anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp; or &nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=)

We get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Work. Life. Design. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
